Split each input into a tuple
new_elements = []
for element in tuple:
    Determine the length of element

    
    for i in range(len(element2)-len(element1)):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        else:
            Append max number of length len(element1) + i (e.g., 6, 999999)

for each element
    Find the factors of the digits length
    if the length is odd:
        only 1 will be used as a factor
    if even:
        include all factors aside from the number itself
